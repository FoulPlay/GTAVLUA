YOU NEED THIS TO RUN THE SCRIPT!

http://gtaforums.com/topic/789139-vrelhook-lua-plugin-for-script-hook-v/

Install: To install, put the script in your "addins" folder in the "scripts" folder.


Known issue: This doesn't run on startup. You need to reload all addons to get it working. 
This could be a bug with the Lua hook for ScriptHookV. I still don't know why it doesn't work on start up.


Use the "Insert" button to spawn them.


Use the "Delete" button to delete them.

They will be automatically deleted when they are dead.
